# PROJECT STATE

## Product objective
Increase futsal venue utilization and revenue through reliable availability and mobile booking, with integrated venue operations, competitions, and a futsal-specific public presence.

## Product source
`docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` — Futsal Authoritative Product Specification v1.0.

## Implementation workflow
`docs/SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW-V4.md`.

## Current stack
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces
- Mobile: Expo SDK 57, React Native 0.86, TypeScript, Expo Router
- API: Node.js, TypeScript, Express 5
- Database: PostgreSQL/Neon-compatible, Drizzle ORM
- Validation/contracts: Zod
- Auth: password + short-lived JWT access token + rotated opaque refresh session
- Localization: shared Dari/Pashto/English resources with RTL metadata

## Core architecture decisions
- Structured monolith; no microservices.
- Mobile is the primary customer interface.
- API runtime uses `DATABASE_URL`; Drizzle migration work prefers `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.
- Server owns authorization, venue ownership, entitlement, live availability, confirmation price, promotion validity and notification fan-out.
- One Venue Owner account maps to at most one venue.
- Premium trial is exactly 72 hours and starts explicitly.
- Booking/manual booking/blocks share one occupancy source of truth.
- PostgreSQL booking/block writes serialize per playing area with a transaction-scoped advisory lock.
- Cached availability is read-only orientation data; live server confirmation is required for booking.
- Promotions reference exact live future inventory; they do not create separate capacity.
- Promotion discounted price is applied server-side to live availability and persisted at booking confirmation.
- Booking, blocking, expiry, suspension or entitlement loss invalidates active promotion inventory.
- Venue follows are public user→venue relationships and do not expose private venue/customer data.
- In-app notifications are persisted server-side and deduped by user + event key.
- Marketing notifications are limited to 3 per user per rolling 24 hours.
- Push foundation stores Expo push devices and PENDING delivery/outbox rows; no external push dispatch worker/provider is enabled yet.
- Afghanistan launch venue timezone defaults to `Asia/Kabul`; persisted timestamps are UTC instants.

## Current implementation phase
Phase 4 — Promotions, Feed and Notifications.

## Migration baseline
Committed canonical migrations:
- `0000_dear_mole_man` — Phase 1.
- `0001_clean_retro_girl` — Phase 2.
- `0002_careless_jack_power` — Phase 3.

Phase 4 schema changes still require generation of `0003_*.sql`.

## Phase 1 status
Foundation implemented and previously verified.

## Phase 2 status
Implemented. Canonical migration is committed. Final end-to-end device verification was not separately re-confirmed after later stacked phases.

## Phase 3 status
Implemented with canonical `0002_careless_jack_power` migration committed.

Phase 3 includes:
- live public venue availability,
- online/manual booking,
- owner blocks,
- cancellation,
- owner schedule,
- atomic playing-area conflict protection,
- actor-scoped idempotency,
- offline cached availability that cannot book,
- player/owner booking UI,
- Phase 3 resilience verifier and test plan.

Latest reported verification before Phase 4:
- Phase 3 resilience verifier passed.
- API TypeScript passed after route-param fixes.
- remaining mobile tab typing issue was fixed and pushed.
- a final full `pnpm verify` result after that last fix has not yet been supplied.

Do not retroactively label Phase 3 fully verified until the full command is confirmed green.

## Phase 4 delivered

### Promotions
- Owner selects a real current future slot from live availability.
- Discount price must be lower than the current server slot price.
- Active promotion is unique per exact slot; a closed promotion does not permanently reserve that slot identity.
- Live availability exposes discounted price, original price and promotion ID.
- Online booking persists the discounted server price.
- Booking/blocking closes overlapping promotions inside the real database occupancy transaction.
- Read-time refresh closes expired, suspended or no-longer-entitled promotions.
- Owner can manually close active promotions.
- Public Feed contains only effective ACTIVE promotions.

### Venue posts
- Owner immediate publish/unpublish.
- Text + optional HTTPS image URL.
- Structured CTA: none, venue or active promotion.
- Competition CTA intentionally remains unavailable until the competition phase.
- Re-publishing rejects stale promotion CTA.
- Public feed/post reads exclude suspended venue content.

### Follow and Feed
- Authenticated users can follow/unfollow active venues idempotently.
- Public Feed combines promotions and posts.
- Following Feed scopes content to followed venues.
- Player venue page shows follow state and follower count.
- Promotion/post cards deep-link through typed Futsal destinations.

### Notifications
- Persisted in-app notification history.
- Booking confirmed/cancelled notifications.
- Follower promotion and venue-post notifications.
- User preferences for in-app, push, promotions and venue posts.
- User + event dedupe.
- Marketing frequency cap: 3 alerts per rolling 24 hours.
- Expo push device registration model.
- Push delivery/outbox rows for later provider dispatch.
- Mobile notification center, read state and preferences.

### Mobile UX
- Player Feed tab.
- All/Following filter.
- Discounted/original AFN display.
- Promotion-aware venue availability.
- Venue follow/unfollow.
- Venue post detail + CTA.
- Notification center and preferences.
- Owner dashboard marketing entry points.
- Owner Promotions list/create/close.
- Owner Posts list/create/publish/unpublish.
- Dari/Pashto/English localization with RTL support.

### Verification coverage
- Phase 4 contract validation.
- Promotion API tests.
- Follow idempotency test.
- Post publish/unpublish test.
- Notification dedupe test.
- 3-per-24-hour marketing frequency test.
- Booking→notification integration test.
- Promoted-slot booking-price regression.
- `verify:phase4` static invariant gate.
- `docs/PHASE-04-TEST-PLAN.md`.

## Phase 4 verification status
Status: **Implemented; migration generation, local verification and live device testing pending.**

Run on the user environment:

1. Pull `phase-04-promotions-feed-notifications`.
2. Generate migration:
   ```powershell
   pnpm db:generate
   ```
   Expected: `0003_*.sql` and `meta/0003_snapshot.json`.
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   pnpm verify
   ```
   This now runs Phase 4 verifier, Phase 3 verifier, workspace typechecks, tests and builds.
4. Apply:
   ```powershell
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```
5. Complete `docs/PHASE-04-TEST-PLAN.md`.
6. Commit/push the generated Phase 4 Drizzle migration.

Do not call Phase 4 fully verified until those steps pass.

## Known runtime requirement
For a physical Android phone:
- Expo Metro tunnel/LAN reachability and API reachability are separate.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` must point to an API URL the phone can actually open.
- If LAN access to port 4000 fails, run `ngrok http 4000` and use that HTTPS URL in `apps/mobile/.env.local`, then restart Expo with `--clear`.

## Next phase
Phase 5 — Teams and Player Identity.

Phase 5 should begin from the Phase 4 branch after the Phase 4 migration/verification baseline is reviewed.
